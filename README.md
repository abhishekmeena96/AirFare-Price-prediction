# AirFare Price Prediction

## Overview
The **AirFare Price Prediction** project is aimed at predicting the prices of airline tickets using machine learning models. By analyzing a wide range of features such as **airline type**, **departure time**, **arrival time**, **duration**, and other factors, we can build a model that estimates the airfare for different flights. This project helps travelers, airlines, and other stakeholders to forecast ticket prices, optimize booking strategies, and identify trends in the airfare market.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection
- **Sources**: Gather data from sources like online travel portals, flight APIs, or open datasets.
- **Data Types**:
  - **Airline Name**
  - **Flight Number**
  - **Source and Destination**
  - **Date of Travel**
  - **Departure and Arrival Times**
  - **Duration**
  - **Ticket Price**

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Handling missing data** and **outliers**.
- Converting date and time data into useful features (e.g., month, weekday).
- **Encoding categorical variables** like airline names and cities.
  
### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Creating new features** such as:
  - Travel time/duration.
  - Departure time buckets (morning, afternoon, night).
  - Layovers and stopover counts.

### 4. Model Building
- Train machine learning models (e.g., `Linear Regression`, `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`) on historical airfare data.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** and **cross-validation** to optimize model performance.

### 5. Evaluation and Prediction
- Measure model accuracy using metrics like **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) and **RÂ² score**.
- Generate predictions for future flights based on the trained model.

## Conclusion
The **AirFare Price Prediction** project helps predict airline ticket prices by leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques. It provides insights for travelers to make informed booking decisions and for airlines to adjust pricing strategies based on predicted demand and trends.
